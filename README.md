## Overview

Lab 4 implements the exercises for the course or assignment specified by the instructor. This README provides instructions to set up the environment, run the project, and understand the repository layout.

## Requirements

- A recent version of Git
- Node.js (if this project uses JavaScript/Node) or the appropriate runtime/toolchain for the project's language
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

> If the lab uses a specific language or framework (Java, Python, C#, etc.), replace the above with exact versions and installation steps.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/johnjohn4u/Todio_John-Sebastian_Lab4.git
   cd Todio_John-Sebastian_Lab4

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):

   - For Node.js projects:

     npm install

   - For Python projects (use a virtual environment):

     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
     venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
     pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Build the project (if applicable):

   - For Node.js:
